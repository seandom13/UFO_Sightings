# UFO_Sightings

* Created a web page using HTML.
* Wrote a Javascript script to add a table to the webpage using Javascript Objects with columns for `date/time`,
`city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`. 
* Used a date form in the HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that will listen for events and search 
through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.
